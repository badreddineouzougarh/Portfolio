Using IoT sensors and the OGC SensorThings API, the system tracks container fill levels, sends alerts to waste collectors, and enables efficient resource allocation. It also employs a deep learning model to predict bin fill levels, ensuring timely intervention and reducing environmental hazards caused by overflowing bins."

As a Geomatics student, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) often serve as essential data collection platforms, bridging the gap between theoretical study and practical application. In this project, we aim to develop a prototype quadcopter drone tailored to our academic and research needs, such as detecting and analyzing urban trees. "
